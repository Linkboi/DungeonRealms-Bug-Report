I've noticed while I was wondering trough Dark oak's.
That there are a fair amount of mobs that take down your weapon durability in one go, which ends up destroying it. 
So far I've only expirenced this with T2 weapons. 
As the mobs are level 22 ish with full T2 gear on I am sure that it should be normal to not lose your weapon in 10 swings.
Anyhow. Right after I lost my weapons and with one relog, either the hearthstone or realm fragment get dupilicated. 
So far not a big deal, as I can stack them even though I think that should not be possible.

I've also noticed a bug with allows me to stack up all my Teleport books. I remember this was not used to be like it.

This all I can bring from so far. I hope it's a bit helpfull ^^
